# Running workflows

[DISK](https://disk.isi.edu) can execute workflows on different workflows systems as long as a [method adapter](/method-adapter) is available.
Each LOI defines how any parameters and data obtained as result of the *data query* will be used when creating one or more workflow executions.
The outputs and metadata generated on this process is stored as a TLOI.

Additionally, A LOI can define a meta workflow to run using as input the result of the workflow executions.
