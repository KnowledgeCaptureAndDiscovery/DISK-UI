# Creating New Questions

DISK questions and hypotheses use terms from the DISK Scientific Questions ontology.  This ontology represents the question types that users take as a starting point to create their own specific questions.  A question type is represented as a Question Template that includes Question Variables.  The Question Variables are placeholders for the specific objects in a user's questions.

Three steps are required to extend DISK with new kinds of questions:

1. Add a new Question Template to the ontology.
2. Add the Question Variables for the Question Template to the ontology.
3. Publish the updated ontology.

In the following sections, we will introduce the ontologies used in DISK and describe how to extend the DISK Scientific Questions ontology.
