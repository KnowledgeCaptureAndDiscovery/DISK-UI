# Create new Question

!!! Note
    Questions are written in a Ontology

Three steps are required to create new questions:

1. Extend the Question Template Ontology.
2. Add the Question and Question Variables in the ontology.
3. Publish the ontology.

In the following sections, we will describe *what is a ontology*, *which ontologies are used by DISK* and *how to extend the Question Template Ontology*
