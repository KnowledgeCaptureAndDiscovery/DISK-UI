# Create hypothesis and questions


The aim of an investigation is to answer a **question**, which is
most useful if it is well scoped to be tractable given the time
and resources available. 

Questions can be posed as testing a hypothesis, which would
be a statement that can be supported or dismissed based on
data analysis.

DISK starts with a hypothesis, and then a question.

## Hypothesis

### Create a Hypothesis

You can create a hypothesis by clicking on the **Create Hypothesis** button.

Then, you must fill the form with the following information:

- **Hypothesis name**: The name of the hypothesis.
- **Hypothesis description**: A description of the hypothesis.
- **Hypothesis Notes**: Any notes you want to add to the hypothesis.

For example, here we have created a new hypothesis called **"The effect of the weather in the number bikes rented"**.

## Question 

Questions can be posed as testing a hypothesis.

### Create a Question

You can display the questions available by clicking on the **Select Hypothesis Question** drop down list.
Then, select a question from the list.

!!! Info
    The questions are created by the Expert User.

## Question Variables

Some questions have to do with associations between observed variables. 

!!! Example 
    In neuroscience we can ask if a **brain characteristic**, such as *hippocampus size*,
    is associated with a **disorder** such as *ADHD (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)*.

### Select a Question Variable

To select the question variables, you need to click in TextField of each **Variables** button.
In our bike example, we can ask if the number of bikes rented is associated with the weather.

Finally, you can click in the **Save ** button to save the hypothesis and question.
